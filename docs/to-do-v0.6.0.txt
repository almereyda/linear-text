# Publish Linear Text v0.6.0: Better Local Images

Abstract all the file handling interfaces to support browser-fs-access and Node.js implementations.
Implement a Node.js-based file reader that can report the absolute text file path and get the file contents so that relative path images can be loaded.

  See local electron branch and delete it.
Test if text is an image and not a URI (no scheme). If so, add file protocol with the text file path like `'file:///home/stephen/docs/notes/' + 'text'`.
Add handlebar buttons for edit image dialog and clear/erase. Should work for groups too.
Renames
  Revisit the line-*element naming. I always seem to pick the wrong file.
  Rename --note-width to --line-width.
  Rename grab icon to handle icon maybe.
Restore Electron window size.
