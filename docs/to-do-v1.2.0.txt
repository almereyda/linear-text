## Research
Review web.dev.
Review Twitter share cards.
Investigate why Create React App / Webpack can't detect file renames.
Review robots.txt.
Verify browserstest is running.
Add undo/redo action labeling. In general, it'd be nice to gently alert when the file has been saved or which particular action had been undone/redone.
Add date TextType support.
Image thumbnailing support.
Investigate CSS contain performance boosts.
File of files using file scheme, file extension, and file content heuristics.
Multiple open file tabs.
